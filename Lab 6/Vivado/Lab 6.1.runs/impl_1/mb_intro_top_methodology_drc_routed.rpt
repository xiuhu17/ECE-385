Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock mb_block_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin mb_block_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, hexA/clk, mb_block_i/clk_100MHz
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell mb_block_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) mb_block_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell mb_block_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.normal_stop_cmd_rst_i_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) mb_block_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.normal_stop_TClk_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
